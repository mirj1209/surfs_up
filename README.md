## Overview of the Statistical Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy get more information about the temperature trends between June and December in Oahu Hawaii. This is in order to decide whether or not the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable throughout the entire year. 

## Results:

These are the following results for the temperature in Oahu during June: 
-	The mean temperature is 74.9 degrees Fahrenheit 
-	The minimum temperature is 64.0 degrees Fahrenheit 
-	The maximum temperature is 85.0 degrees Fahrenheit

One can infer that during the month of June, the temperature is relatively high and therefore, the ice cream business and the surfing business would be relatively active during this time.

The following are the results for the temperature in Oahu during December:
-	The mean temperature is 71.0 degrees Fahrenheit 
-	The minimum temperature is 56.0 degrees Fahrenheit 
-	The maximum temperature is 83.0 degrees Fahrenheit

One can infer that during the month of December, the temperature is really similar to the temperature in June (only difference being a bigger dip in the minimum temperature). Thus, it would be reasonable to expect a similar business outcome. That is, without considering the difference in timing in terms of holidays as December hold the Christmas holidays while June is during the summer. 

##  Summary:

Overall, judging from the fact that the temperature during both seasons are very much alike, the business activity should be expected to be roughly similar. These finding could change depending on further improvements on this project. Improvements such as, creating and adding data frames for other (if not all) months of the year; and possibly looking into touristic activity (like number of flights leaving and going into Oahu) during those months.
